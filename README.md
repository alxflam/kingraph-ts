> ðŸ‘ª Plots family trees using TypeScript and Graphviz

A family tree plotter with a very simple syntax. It probably doesn't cover everything [bigger tools](https://gramps-project.org/) do, but covers 90% of it for the sake of simplicity.

## Getting started

A family tree is a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) file. To get started, store the following text in a file called `family.yaml`:

```yaml
families:
  - parents: [Marge, Homer]
    children: [Bart, Lisa, Maggie]
  - parents: [Lisa, Milhouse]
    children: [Zia]

people:
  Marge:
    fullname: Marjorie Bouvier Simpson
```

Build the project and then run the CLI application to transform a YAML file into a Graphviz DOT file or SVG:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
./out/index.js -y family.yaml -f dot > family.dot
```

You can also try to generate a SVG with `kingraph-ts` directly by using `--format svg`, but you'll likely [run into memory issues](https://github.com/rstacruz/kingraph/issues/6).
